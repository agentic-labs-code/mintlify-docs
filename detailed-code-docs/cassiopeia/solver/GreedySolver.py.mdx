## High-level description
The `GreedySolver` class in Cassiopeia is an abstract base class for implementing top-down greedy algorithms for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It provides a framework for recursively splitting a set of samples based on a split criterion, building the tree from the root down to the leaves. Subclasses of `GreedySolver` implement the specific logic for performing the split.

## Code Structure
The `GreedySolver` class defines the overall structure of a greedy solver, including methods for performing splits, computing mutation frequencies, and adding duplicate samples to the tree. The `perform_split` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to define the specific split criterion.

## References
- `CassiopeiaSolver`: The `GreedySolver` class inherits from the `CassiopeiaSolver` abstract base class.
- `solver_utilities`: The `GreedySolver` class uses utility functions from the `solver_utilities` module, such as `node_name_generator` and `transform_priors`.
- `missing_data_methods`: The `GreedySolver` class uses functions from the `missing_data_methods` module to handle missing data during character splits.
- `find_duplicate_groups`: The `GreedySolver` class uses the `find_duplicate_groups` function from the `cassiopeia.mixins` module to identify duplicate samples.

## Symbols

### `GreedySolver`
#### Description
This class represents a greedy solver for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It provides a framework for recursively splitting a set of samples based on a split criterion, building the tree from the root down to the leaves.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| prior_transformation | str | Function to use when transforming priors into weights. Defaults to "negative_log". |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Transform the priors into weights using the specified `prior_transformation`.
2. Recursively split the set of samples using the `perform_split` method:
   a. Create an ancestral node for each split.
   b. Place the resulting partitions as daughter clades.
3. Continue splitting until each partition contains only a single sample.
4. If a split cannot be performed, create a polytomy.
5. Add duplicate samples to the tree.
6. Collapse mutationless edges if specified.

### `perform_split`
#### Description
This abstract method defines the logic for partitioning a set of samples. It must be implemented by subclasses of `GreedySolver`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | Character matrix |
| samples | List[int] | A list of samples to partition |
| weights | Optional[Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]] | Weighting of each (character, state) pair. Typically a transformation of the priors. |
| missing_state_indicator | int | Character representing missing data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| left_partition | List[Union[int, str]] | The left partition group |
| right_partition | List[Union[int, str]] | The right partition group |

### `compute_mutation_frequencies`
#### Description
This method computes the frequencies of each character/state pair in a given set of samples.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| samples | List[str] | The set of samples to consider |
| unique_character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | The character matrix |
| missing_state_indicator | int | Character representing missing data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| freq_dict | Dict[int, Dict[int, int]] | A dictionary mapping each character to a dictionary of state/sample frequency pairs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterate over each character in the character matrix.
2. For each character, count the occurrences of each state for the given samples.
3. Store the frequencies in a dictionary:
   - Keys are characters
   - Values are dictionaries mapping states to their frequencies

### `__add_duplicates_to_tree`
#### Description
This private method adds duplicate samples to the tree.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | nx.DiGraph | The tree to add duplicates to |
| character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | Character matrix |
| node_name_generator | Generator[str, None, None] | Generator for creating unique node names |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | nx.DiGraph | The tree with duplicates added |

#### Internal Logic
1. Identify duplicate samples using the `find_duplicate_groups` function.
2. For each group of duplicates:
   a. Create a new internal node.
   b. Connect the new node to the original sample.
   c. Connect the new node to all duplicates of the original sample.

## Side Effects
The `solve` method modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object by populating its tree attribute.

## Dependencies
- `networkx`: Used for representing and manipulating the tree.
- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations.
- `pandas`: Used for representing the character matrix.
