Here's a documentation for the target file `cassiopeia/tools/topology.py`:

## High-level description
This file contains utility functions to assess topological properties of phylogenetic trees, specifically focusing on balance and expansion. It provides methods to compute expansion p-values and cophenetic correlation for CassiopeiaTree objects.

## Code Structure
The main functions in this file are `compute_expansion_pvalues` and `compute_cophenetic_correlation`. These functions operate on CassiopeiaTree objects and utilize various helper functions and statistical methods to analyze tree topology.

## Symbols

### `compute_expansion_pvalues`
#### Description
This function calculates expansion p-values for nodes in a phylogenetic tree, assessing the probability of observing a given subclade size under a neutral coalescent model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | The phylogenetic tree to analyze |
| min_clade_size | int | Minimum number of leaves in a subtree to be considered |
| min_depth | int | Minimum depth of clade to be considered |
| copy | bool | Whether to return a copy of the tree or modify in-place |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree or None | The tree with added expansion p-values (if copy=True) or None |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes attributes for each node in the tree
2. Traverses the tree in depth-first order
3. For each node, calculates the expansion p-value based on the number of leaves in its subtree
4. Adds the calculated p-values as attributes to the tree nodes

#### Performance Considerations
The function runs in O(n log n) time for balanced trees, but can be up to O(n^3) for highly unbalanced trees.

### `compute_cophenetic_correlation`
#### Description
Computes the cophenetic correlation of a lineage, which is the Pearson correlation between the phylogenetic distance and character dissimilarity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | The phylogenetic tree to analyze |
| weights | pd.DataFrame (optional) | Phylogenetic weights matrix |
| dissimilarity_map | pd.DataFrame (optional) | Dissimilarity matrix between samples |
| dissimilarity_function | Callable | Function to compute dissimilarities between samples |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| correlation | float | The cophenetic correlation value |
| significance | float | The significance of the correlation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Computes or uses provided phylogenetic weight matrix and dissimilarity map
2. Aligns matrices to ensure they correspond to the same set of leaves
3. Converts matrices to condensed distance matrices
4. Calculates Pearson correlation between phylogenetic distances and dissimilarities

#### Performance Considerations
If weights and dissimilarity map are not precomputed, the function runs in O(mn^2 + n^2logn + n^2) time, where n is the number of leaves and m is the number of characters.

### `simple_coalescent_probability`
#### Description
Computes the probability of observing a given number of samples in a lineage under a simple coalescent model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| n | int | Number of leaves in subtree |
| b | int | Number of leaves in one lineage |
| k | int | Number of lineages |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| probability | float | Probability of observing b leaves on one lineage in a tree of n total leaves |

### `nCk`
#### Description
Computes the binomial coefficient (n choose k).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| n | int | Total number of items |
| k | int | Number of items to choose |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coefficient | float | The number of ways to choose k items from n |

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- cassiopeia.data

## Error Handling
The code uses custom exceptions from `cassiopeia.mixins` to handle errors specific to CassiopeiaTree operations.
