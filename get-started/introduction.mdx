### What is Stanza?
Stanza by Agentic Labs is an AI-powered documentation tool that generates comprehensive, queryable documentation for your codebase in minutes.

Engineering teams use Stanza to make their code accessible to all members of the team, technical and non-technical.

### What's in this demo?
We documented Cassiopeia - a scientific python package for analyzing cell division from DNA, developed by Yosef Lab at UC Berkeley.

### Get started

1. Technical summary: Start with the [top-level overview](/detailed-code-docs/project_root) to understand Cassiopeia's structure and how it works.
2. AI-powered answers: Use the search bar to ask questions like:

    * "How do I start a processing pipeline?"
    * "What algorithms are used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction?"
    * "Explain the simulation models in Cassiopeia"

<Note>To get AI completions, click `Can you tell me about...` button after typing your question</Note>

3. Key components: Dive into some of Cassiopeia's main modules:

    * Tree Reconstruction: See [GreedySolver](/detailed-code-docs/cassiopeia/solver/GreedySolver.py) to understand how trees are inferred from a set of samples.
    * Visualization: Look at [cassiopeia/plotting](/detailed-code-docs/cassiopeia/plotting/) for data visualization

### What we offer
* Lightning-fast doc generation
* Real-time syncing with your code
* Code hosting integrations (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket)
* Documentation provider intgrations (Confluence, Gitbook, Mintlify, Github Pages)
